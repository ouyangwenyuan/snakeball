    Jigsaw Gallery Privacy Policy. Jigsaw Gallery is not responsible for and does
    not control Third Party Services. Jigsaw Gallery provides these Third Party Services
    only as a convenience to you. Jigsaw Gallery has no obligation to review or monitor,
    and does not approve, endorse, or make any representations or warranties with

    days following our posting of notice of the changes on our Site. These changes

    Apps following notice of such changes shall indicate your acknowledgement of such
    changes and agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of such changes.
    The date on which the latest update was made is indicated at the top of this document.
    We recommend that you print a copy of this Agreement for your reference and revisit
    this webpage from time to time to ensure you are aware of any changes.\n9.2 Notice\nAny
    notice provided to Jigsaw Gallery pursuant to this Agreement should be sent to:
    jigsaw_Gallery@outlook.com\n9.3 Severability\nIf any provision of this Agreement
    is, for any reason, held to be invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions

    in this Section 10 apply, but solely with respect to Apps from the Apple Application
    Store.\n10.1 Acknowledgement: Jigsaw Gallery and you acknowledge that this Agreement

    devices. In this policy, \u201CJigsaw Gallery\u201D may also refer to \"We\" or
    \"Us\".\nThis Agreement requires the use of arbitration on an individual basis
    to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limits
    the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.\nThis Terms of Service
    (\u201CAgreement\u201D) sets forth the legally binding terms for your use of any
    App (including any related services provided by Jigsaw Gallery). By using any
    App, you are accepting this Agreement and you represent and warrant that you have
    the right, authority, and capacity to enter into this Agreement. If you do not
    agree with all of the provisions of this Agreement, please do not use any App.
    This Agreement is the final, complete and exclusive agreement of you and Jigsaw
    Gallery with respect to the subject matters hereof (including the Apps) and supersedes
    and merges all prior discussions and agreements between the parties with respect
    to such subject matters (including any prior End User License Agreements, Terms
    of Service or Privacy Policy).\n1. End User License Agreement\n1.1 License\nSubject
    to the terms of this Agreement, Jigsaw Gallery grants you a non-transferable,

    purpose of downloading, installing and executing, the number of copies for which
    you are authorized by the download site of each App on a mobile device that you
    own or control for your use (the \u201CLicense\u201D).\n1.2 Certain Restrictions\nThe

    or reverse engineer any part of Apps, except to the extent the foregoing restrictions
    are expressly prohibited by applicable law; (c) you shall not access any App in
    order to build a similar or competitive service or application; (d) except as
    expressly stated herein, no part of any App may be copied, reproduced, distributed,
    republished, downloaded, displayed, posted or transmitted in any form or by any
    means, or (e) you shall not remove or destroy any copyright notices or other proprietary
    markings contained on or in any App. Any future release, update, or other addition
    to functionality of any App (including in-App purchases, additional levels, and

    otherwise provided in terms associated with such addition. All copyright and other
